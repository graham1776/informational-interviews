        <h1 class="module-title">The Two Magic Questions</h1>
        <p class="module-subtitle">The most powerful moment of any informational interview happens in the final minutes. Learn the two questions that have launched countless careers.</p>
      </header>
      
      <div class="module-content-body">
        <p>The End phase is the <strong>most important part</strong> of the informational interview. It is also the part most often left out. I unintentionally left it out of many interviews during graduate school. While practically easy, it is usually very difficult to force yourself to do.</p>
        
        <p>As previously mentioned, it revolves around these two questions:</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <div class="highlight-box-title">The Two Magic Questions</div>
          <p><span class="inline-highlight">1. "Is there anyone you think I should talk to?"</span></p>
          <p><span class="inline-highlight">2. "Is there an opportunity for me right now at this company?"</span></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>These two questions have afforded me many investment opportunities, jobs, mentorship, new networks, colleagues and friends. Without these two questions, often informational interviews are easily forgotten – a one-time talk with someone. But using them, you've now turned your meeting into a "call to action," directly asking someone to help you. The best part: <strong>nine of ten times they do</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>Why These Questions Work</h2>
        
        <p>These questions work for several powerful psychological reasons:</p>
        
        <p><strong>They invoke reciprocity.</strong> After you've spent 30-60 minutes genuinely listening to someone and showing interest in their expertise, most people naturally want to return the favor.</p>
        
        <p><strong>They're low-commitment.</strong> The first question doesn't ask them to hire you or make a major effort. It simply asks if they know someone who might be interesting for you to talk to next.</p>
        
        <p><strong>They create clear next steps.</strong> Most conversations naturally dissipate without clear action items. These questions transform a pleasant chat into forward momentum.</p>
        
        <div class="success-story-box">
          <div class="success-story-header">
            <div class="author-avatar">
              <img src="../../images/success-stories/brian.jpg" alt="Brian P." onerror="this.innerHTML='BP'">
            </div>
            <div class="author-info">
              <h4>Brian P.</h4>
              <p>VP of Development</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="success-story-content">
            <p>"During a competition, I gained five minutes of access to the biggest retail developer in Los Angeles. Their time was short, but I made a good enough impression and followed up enough that I was able to gain another longer meeting. Then another. Then the billionaire invited me over the next time! And this time it wasn't to catch up; it was to offer me a job."</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="interactive-note">
          <div class="interactive-note-title">Success Pattern</div>
          <p>Notice how Brian turned a 5-minute conversation into multiple meetings using follow-up, which eventually led to a job offer.</p>
          <p>The key was creating continuity through gentle persistence.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Perfect Timing</h2>
        
        <p>You've now spent 45 minutes with someone, and the end is near. The coffee is almost gone, your butt hurts, and you are late for work. They probably feel the same way. It is time to wrap it up, and there are a few ways to do so.</p>
        
        <p>You can thank the other person for their time, and regurgitate one or two things you learned that day. You can preface the last questions with "one last thing…." You can let them know you need to get to work. Frame the conversation so they know it is wrapping up.</p>
        
        <p>Remember though: <strong>Do not leave without asking the questions</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>My Recommended Script</h3>
        
        <div class="template-box">
          <div class="template-box-header">
            <div class="template-box-title">End-of-Interview Script</div>
            <div class="template-box-actions">
              <button class="action-button" onclick="copyTemplate('end-script')">Copy</button>
              <button class="action-button" onclick="saveTemplate('end-script')">Save</button>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="template-content" id="end-script">"Wow this has been great. I've really enjoyed learning about your career and what you do. I really liked hearing about your perspective on [specific insight they shared]. Thanks again for your time. 

Before we go though, there's two questions I always like to ask at the end of our interviews. One is "Is there anyone you think I should talk to?" and two is "Is there an opportunity for me right now at this company?"

[Smile and wait patiently for their response]"</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>The first part lets the other person know you are wrapping up. You praise and thank them for their sage advice and time. Then you frame the questions as a personal rule: this is just something you do all the time, you aren't asking for anything extraordinary or exceptional.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, you smile and/or laugh, letting them know while an earnest question, it's ok if they say no, because it's not too serious. Then wait, giving them a chance to think and respond. It usually works.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <div class="highlight-box-title">My Personal Experience</div>
          <p>I met with a commercial real estate developer who initially said they had no openings. After asking my two magic questions, they paused, thought for a moment, and said: "Actually, we've been thinking about adding someone to our acquisitions team. Let me talk to my partner and see if we could create a position."</p>
          <p>Three weeks later, I was working there. If I hadn't asked, I would never have known the opportunity existed.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Handling Their Response</h2>
        
        <p>If they say yes to either question, ask for specific steps to follow up:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>If they think of two or three names to meet with, write them down and tell the person you'll shoot them an email later asking for their info.</li>
          <li>If they say there might be an opportunity for work, ask them who you should talk to next, and when?</li>
          <li>No matter what, be sure to ask when you can follow up again.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>After that, it's over. Shake hands, part ways, and follow up soon (which we'll cover in the next section).</p>
        
        <div class="interactive-note">
          <div class="interactive-note-title">Quick Tip</div>
          <p>I always keep a small notebook with me during these interviews. When someone mentions contacts or opportunities, I write them down immediately. This shows you're serious and ensures you don't forget important details.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>When They Say No</h2>
        
        <p>Sometimes, the person truly doesn't have connections to share or opportunities available. That's completely fine! The value of the informational interview extends far beyond immediate job offers.</p>
        
        <p>If they say no, you've still:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Built a new professional relationship</li>
          <li>Gained industry insights and perspective</li>
          <li>Practiced your networking skills</li>
          <li>Created a touchpoint for future follow-up</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Simply thank them for their time and insights, and move on to your follow-up process.</p>

          <div class="success-story-content">
            <p>"After applying to myriad jobs throughout southern California, across many hospitals, I was never able to make the leap to a different unit. I didn't have the right expertise, according to HR. Finally conceding to give the 'informational interview' approach a try, I talked with my OBGYN. I let her know how much I wanted to work in the NICU unit. Literally before I could finish, she said: 'You know, I am like this [two fingers crossed] with the CEO of that hospital. Would you like me to put a good word in?' I now have my dream job, simply by talking with someone who happened to be connected and generous."</p>
