      <div class="module-content-body">
        <h2>Reaching Out Effectively</h2>
        
        <p>Now that you've picked someone to ask, how do you ask them and why will they say yes? This part of the process can often take the longest and require the most persistence. You will need to be okay with being rejected or ignored, emailing or contacting someone multiple times, and working hard to get interviews. Over the course of graduate school, I emailed and followed up with the same person over ten times before I was able to meet with him. The crazy part was: he really didn't mind. I was one of 100's of emails he got per day, and he didn't think I was bothering him at all. Getting the interview is the hardest part of the process.</p>
        
        <h2>Why People Say Yes</h2>
        
        <p>When I first started doing informationals, I constantly wondered why anyone would say yes to my request for one. I have been ignored far more than responded to "yes" or "no". Looking back through a season of lots of interviews, I was only responded to by 30-40% of warm introductions and maybe ten percent of cold introductions. Usually people I've asked have never done an informational interview, do not know what to expect, and need to be explained why you want to meet with them.</p>
        
        <p>These barriers are low enough, though, even if the interviewee has his initial objections. Why? People love to help, love to give and it makes them feel good. It strokes their egos, making them feel important enough for someone to ask about their life and to learn from them. Most people love giving advice and offering to help in any way possible. Many just need a reason or forum to do so, but no one has ever asked. I am continually amazed at how many "industry veterans" I meet who tell me: "I love doing these, but I only do a handful each year. I really don't understand why more people don't reach out?"</p>
        
        <div class="interactive-note">
          <div class="interactive-note-title">The Psychology of Yes</div>
          <p>People agree to informational interviews for several core psychological reasons:</p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 1rem;">
            <li><strong>Status and Recognition</strong> - Being asked for advice affirms their expertise</li>
            <li><strong>Reciprocity</strong> - Many benefited from similar help in their early career</li>
            <li><strong>Generosity</strong> - Most people genuinely enjoy helping others</li>
            <li><strong>Self-reflection</strong> - Talking about their work helps them process their own journey</li>
            <li><strong>Network expansion</strong> - They're curious about new connections too</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>But if this is true, then why was I ignored so many times? I usually chalk it up to 90% busyness and 10% "they don't want to meet with you." I now get hundreds of emails per day and it is difficult to give a thoughtful response to non-priority emails. Generally, I often ignore one-off emails from people I don't know or save them for later. These saved emails often get lost. Busy seasons cause non-urgent emails to be skipped over. Often I may not respond to someone until they have emailed me two to three times so I know they are serious and not just blasting emails to hundreds of people. Persistence is key and you really cannot bug someone too much in our modern "always on" world. The first thing you need to do is ask!</p>
        
        <h2>The Perfect Outreach Formula</h2>
        
        <p>Asking for an informational interview is simple and follows a straightforward formula:</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <div class="highlight-box-title">Email Structure</div>
          <ol style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Who am I?</li>
            <li>What am I asking for?</li>
            <li>Why?</li>
            <li>Why should you meet with me? – Our connection</li>
            <li>Why should you meet with me? – Why it's going to be good for you</li>
            <li>Call to Action</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>To make this concrete, below is the "form request email" I've used in hundreds of emails and conversations to get informationals:</p>
        
        <div class="template-box">
          <div class="template-box-header">
            <div class="template-box-title">Sample Outreach Email</div>
            <div class="template-box-actions">
              <button class="action-button" onclick="copyTemplate('sample-email')">Copy</button>
              <button class="action-button" onclick="saveTemplate('sample-email')">Save</button>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="template-content" id="sample-email">Ron:

I am an MRED Candidate at USC and I would like to request an Informational Interview with you to discuss your insights and perspective on real estate. I received your contact information from Eliot Jones at Clarion and he thought it would be good for me to meet with you. I am especially interested in Industrial Real Estate and would love to hear your experiences in this field and Watson's current activity.

I am available at during the following times to meet with you at your convenience:

Tuesday                8am-1pm

Wednesdays         All Day

Thursdays            Lunch

Fridays                  All Day

Thank you again for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.</div>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Breaking Down the Formula</h2>
        
        <p>Let's analyze each part of this template to understand why it works so well:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Who am I?</h3>
        
        <p><em>"I am an [MRED Candidate at USC] and…"</em></p>
        
        <p>You don't have to be someone important to ask! I believe the less important you are, the higher likelihood you will get an interview. Describe who you are in three to four words. It can be:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>a student at Fresno State</li>
          <li>a property manager at DDG</li>
          <li>an intern at Generation Homes</li>
          <li>a waiter at Joe's</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. What am I asking for?</h3>
        
        <p><em>"…I would like to request an Informational Interview with you…"</em></p>
        
        <p>No need to change this one. You may rephrase if you'd like to say "I'd like to grab coffee with you" or "Catch up with you" or something similar. However, I would recommend keeping it as is so the other person knows exactly what you are asking for and why. You'd hate for the person to think "Why is this person asking me to coffee or trying to catch up? What do they want?" Requesting an informational interview lets them know you are here to learn from them and that is it.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Why?</h3>
        
        <p><em>"…to discuss your insights and perspective on [real estate]."</em></p>
        
        <p>Fill in the field/industry this person is in or the job they have. If you want to learn about marketing, accounting, or acting, write that in. Keep it broad, you'll fill-in more further down.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Why should you meet with me? – Our connection</h3>
        
        <p><em>"[I received your contact information from Eliot Jones at Clarion and he] thought it would be good for me to meet with you."</em></p>
        
        <p>If you don't have a warm connection or were not personally introduced to the person you are asking, find something that connects you! For me this has been as widespread as:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>"I received your contact information from Eliot Jones at Clarion and…</li>
          <li>"I found your contact info on Linkedin and …</li>
          <li>"I saw you speak at the NAIOP conference and …</li>
          <li>"I really liked your blog post on such and such and…</li>
          <li>"We work in the same office building and …</li>
          <li>"I saw the story in the paper about you and…</li>
          <li>…I thought it would be good to meet with you."</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>All of the above work. Any connection (no matter how tenuous) is a connection!</p>
        
        <h3>5. Why should you meet with me? – Why it's going to be good for you</h3>
        
        <p><em>"I am especially interested in [Industrial Real Estate] and would love to hear your experiences in this field and [Watson's] current activity."</em></p>
        
        <p>This section shows that this isn't a form email. You are showing that you know about this person, their career, and you will not be wasting their time. The first blank is the specific field (within the broader one mentioned above) that you know the person works in. Show them you've done a little research! This can be:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>[content marketing]</li>
          <li>[nursing in the ICU]</li>
          <li>[managing film production]</li>
          <li>[corporate accounting]</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The second blank is the company they currently work for. If self-employed, remove this section.</p>
        
        <h3>6. Call to Action</h3>
        
        <p><em>"I am available at during the following times to meet with you at your convenience:</em></p>
        
        <p><em>[Tuesday 8am-1pm</em></p>
        
        <p><em>Wednesdays All Day</em></p>
        
        <p><em>Thursdays Lunch</em></p>
        
        <p><em>Fridays All Day]</em></p>
        
        <p><em>Thank you again for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you."</em></p>
        
        <p>Finally, a call to action. Fill in the blanks for when you are open to meet with them. It shows you are serious. It shows you assume they will say yes, and not offering an option to say no. If you get a response, all the detail is worked out later.</p>

          <div class="success-story-content">
            <p>I used this exact format to reach out to a senior executive at a major commercial real estate firm. Despite having no direct connections to him, I mentioned I had read his article in a trade publication and had specific questions about his perspective on mixed-use developments.</p>
            <p>He responded within 24 hours, saying he rarely takes these meetings but was impressed by the specificity of my interest. That 30-minute coffee chat turned into a 90-minute conversation, which eventually led to a job offer six months later when a position opened up. He later told me he gets dozens of generic networking requests weekly but ignores most because they don't show genuine interest in his specific expertise.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Persistence Pays Off</h2>
        
        <p>Once it's done, use Gmail's Canned Responses to save and write these messages over and over again (or use our <a href="../../tools/email-generator.html">Email Generator tool</a>). I have canned emails for cold emails, warm emails and follow ups, making it easy to type an email address, make small edits and hit "send".</p>
        
        <p>Once you have someone's contact info, reach out and ask them for an informational interview. Remember, this is often a numbers game and requires persistence and continual follow ups. If I do not get a response after 2 weeks or so, I'll forward the old email to the same person with the following text:</p>
        
        <div class="template-box">
          <div class="template-box-header">

          <div class="template-content" id="followup-email">Ron:

I am following up to see if you would have a chance for coffee or lunch. Thanks again for the consideration, and look forward to hearing from you.

        <p>I've followed up with some people I really wanted to meet multiple times, and nobody seems to mind. The Vice President I emailed ten times over as many months before I received a response told me he got every email, but most of the time was too busy or just plain forgot.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <div class="highlight-box-title">The 3-7-7 Follow-Up System</div>
          <p>To maximize your chances of a response without being annoying:</p>
          <ol style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Send initial outreach on day 0</li>
            <li>First follow-up after 3 business days</li>
            <li>Second follow-up after 7 more business days</li>
            <li>Final follow-up after another 7 business days</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This system has consistently yielded 40%+ response rates from warm connections and 15%+ from cold outreach in my experience.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Adapting to Different Platforms</h2>
        
        <p>While email remains the gold standard for professional outreach, you may need to adapt your approach for different platforms:</p>
        
        <h3>LinkedIn</h3>
        
        <p>LinkedIn connection requests have a 300-character limit, so you need to be concise:</p>
        
        <div class="template-box">
          <div class="template-box-header">
            <div class="template-box-title">LinkedIn Connection Request</div>
            <div class="template-box-actions">
              <button class="action-button" onclick="copyTemplate('linkedin-request')">Copy</button>

          </div>
          <div class="template-content" id="linkedin-request">Hi [Name], I'm a [brief identity] interested in learning more about [their specialty/company]. I'd love to connect and potentially schedule a brief informational conversation about your experience in [specific area]. Thank you!</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>After connecting, follow up with a more detailed message similar to the email template.</p>
        
        <h3>Phone Call</h3>
        
        <p>If you have their phone number (perhaps through a mutual contact), calling can be effective for senior executives who may not carefully monitor their email. Keep it brief:</p>
        
        <div class="template-box">
          <div class="template-box-header">
            <div class="template-box-title">Phone Script</div>

              <button class="action-button" onclick="saveTemplate('phone-script')">Save</button>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="template-content" id="phone-script">Hello [Name], this is [Your Name]. I'm [brief identity]. [Mutual contact] suggested I reach out to you. I'm interested in learning more about your experience in [their field], and I was wondering if I could schedule 20-30 minutes for coffee or a brief meeting at your convenience? I'm particularly interested in [specific aspect of their work].</div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Text Message</h3>
        
        <p>Only use text if you have a very warm introduction or were explicitly told to text:</p>
        
        <div class="template-box">
          <div class="template-box-header">
            <div class="template-box-title">Text Message</div>

          <div class="template-content" id="text-message">Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. [Mutual contact] gave me your number and suggested I reach out about [brief context]. Would you be open to a quick coffee to discuss your experience in [specific field]? Thank you!</div>
